        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>My name is Giulia and I'm a UK-based web developer.</strong> Long-time lover of all things digital, I have created, managed and hosted many a website over the years, with a focus on changing designs and writing content on blogging platforms.
          I have now taken the plunge into modern web development using Javascript and React!
        </p>
        <p>
          Creativity and curiosity are my main motivators: I make it a mission to learn something new every day, and web development is ripe with opportunity. 
          I am a service-oriented problem solver with extensive history in five-star customer service, team management and the logistics of running a small business.
          I believe in kindness above all, and I'm usually the peace-maker in a team: I value workplace happiness deeply, and do my best to act on this, no matter my job title.
        </p>
        <p>  
          I dedicate my spare time to music, writing, learning about the endless subjects that interest me, and exploring the wonders of the Internet.
